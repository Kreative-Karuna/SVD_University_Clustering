# SVD_University_Clustering

Business Problem: Processing huge files (e.g., images) for real time applications is not feasible. 

# CRISP-ML(Q):
    Business & Data Understanding:
        Business Problem: Huge files to be analyzed requires a lot of compute and is time consuming
        Business Objective: Minimize the compute & time for processing
        Business Constraints: Minimize the low resolution images
        
        Success Criteria:
            Business: Reduce the compute required by 50%
            ML: Get at least 50% compression
            Economic: ROI of at least $500K over a period of 1 year
